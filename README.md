# Installation and testing instructions 

It should be straightforward to import this to the latest stable Android Studio.

This project consists of two apps, each one on its own module and with its own package. One is the user app for viewing the dummy word game and inputting commands
and the second is the bot app that plays against the user.

For testing, the first thing that needs to be done is installing the Bot app. With the bot app installed the user app can be ran and it will start the bot service 
if necessary and bind to it.
